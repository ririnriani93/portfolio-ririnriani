## Abstract

In the digital era, technological advancements have significantly transformed various sectors, including the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. One of the major pharmaceutical companies in Indonesia has developed a digital platform to manage online prescription fulfillment. However, the platform faces a challenge with low prescription redemption rates, with only 25% of prescriptions successfully redeemed.

This study aims to analyze the factors influencing patientsâ€™ prescription redemption decisions using Random Forest and Logistic Regression. The results show that the Random Forest model combined with the SMOTE ENN technique outperforms other models, achieving the highest F1-score and offering a well-balanced performance between recall and precision.

Feature importance analysis highlights total price, sum quantity, and direct pharmacy redemption as the most influential factors. These findings are expected to support stakeholders in designing more effective strategies to improve prescription redemption rates in digital healthcare platforms.
