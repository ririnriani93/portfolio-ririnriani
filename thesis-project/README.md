# 🎓 Final Thesis – Prescription Redemption Analysis (LogReg vs Random Forest)

This repository contains the final project for my undergraduate thesis:
**"Analysis of Prescription Filling Factors: A Comparison Between Random Forest and Logistic Regression"**

## 📌 Objective

The study aims to identify key factors influencing whether a medical prescription is redeemed or not, and compare the performance of two classification models:
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression

---

## 🧠 Methods

- Data preprocessing (missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Balancing data using SMOTE
- Binary classification modeling (RF, LogReg)
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC AUC

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📁 Files

- A brief summary of the thesis.
- A notebook containing a peek of the machine learning workflow.
- Visual summary of model evaluation metrics.
