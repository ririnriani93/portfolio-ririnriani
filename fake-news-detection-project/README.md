# 📰 Fake News Detection using K-Means Clustering in R

This project was conducted as a final project for a multivariate analysis course.  
It aims to detect fake news by identifying patterns in **numerical features** derived from news articles.

Instead of using raw text, this study used pre-engineered features such as:
- Total word count
- Number of unique words
- Number of sentences
- And other linguistic metrics

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Identify patterns in news articles to separate fake and real news
- **Method**: Unsupervised machine learning using K-Means clustering
- **Data**: Publicly available on Kaggle (summary statistics format)

---

## 📈 Methodology

1. Data cleaning (remove unrealistic entries)
2. Feature normalization
3. Determining optimal clusters with Elbow Method
4. Clustering using K-Means algorithm
5. Analyzing cluster compositions based on fake/real distribution
6. Drawing insight from cluster patterns

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- R (for preprocessing, clustering, and visualization)
- `ggplot2`, `factoextra`, `dplyr` packages
- PowerPoint (for reporting and presentation)

---

## 📁 Files Included

- Final presentation slide summarizing all steps, visuals, and conclusions
